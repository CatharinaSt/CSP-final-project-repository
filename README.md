This progekt is a simple platform game that make you doge repeting opstakels that
gowes on forever.
The score updates over time and decreses if you tutch the opstikel.

All of this progekt was like a brackthoght momet, I would smach my head agenst a brick wall
until it broke just to walk a vew steps amd fined myself infort of anither brick wall.
There was the movment the collison and basekly avry other aspekt of the code. But I did it,
I got a working game althow not my originel idea and not as grand as I would have loved, I
did it and I'm prode of myself for acompleching more than I thoght I could avter starting
this progekt.

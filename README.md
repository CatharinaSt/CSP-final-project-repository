All of this progekt was like a brackthoght momet, I would smach my head agenst a brick wall
until it broke just to walk a vew steps amd fined myself infort of anither brick wall.
There was the movment the collison and basekly avry other aspekt of the code. But I did it,
I got a working game althow not my originel idea and not as grand as I would have loved, I
did it and I'm prode of myself for acompleching more than I thoght I could avter starting
this progekt.
